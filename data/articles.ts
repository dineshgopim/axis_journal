Beating, shouting, humiliation, and intimidation are often justified as discipline rather than recognized as abuse. These practices are frequently intensified by poverty, overcrowding, alcohol misuse, early marriage, and chronic household stress. Girls face compounded disadvantages, including reduced nutrition, shorter breastfeeding duration, limited healthcare access, and lower emotional investment, contributing to higher psychological vulnerability and long term harm."

        content: "Evidence accumulated over two decades leaves no ambiguity. Parental neglect, abuse, and household conflict are among the strongest predictors of child suicide, mental illness, and later violent behavior. <strong>Children do not choose their families, and when homes fail to provide safety and care, society bears the long term cost in lost lives, psychological suffering, and intergenerational trauma.</strong> Protecting children is not only a moral responsibility but a public health imperative. If societies seek to reduce suicide, crime, and mental illness, intervention must begin where harm most often originates, within the home."
